# Blender (BLEND)
This image generation method utilizes a python script which interfaces with a Blender file. Currently it is set up to generate night time images of traffic signs.

## ```scripts/main.py```
This script is used to generate images. It requires an annotation .txt file and will generate the same number of signs of the different classes as in the annotations.
